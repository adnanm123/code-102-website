# Lab: 04 - Structure web pages with HTML

Requirements
Partner up. Decide on a topic for the web site you want to build. Each person will be responsible for 1 page of the site.

1. Together, draw a single wireframe on a whiteboard, that can be used for all the pages of your site.
    - Keep it at low-fidelity.
    - Identify the general content areas.
    - Think carefully! This is what you are going to code up in markup.

2. Apply html to the structure
    - Discuss with your partner what html tags should be used for each part of your wireframe.
    - Think carefully about how the html elements will be nested.

3. Choose your verbiage
    - Write out the key content to fill in each page’s content areas of the wireframe.
    - You don’t need full sentences, but at least a plan for each area of each page.

4. Have your instructor review your wireframe and html plan.

5. Write the code!
    - Each partner creates their own repository to work from. How do we get a new repository on our local computer?
    - Each partner codes their own index.html file, matching the wireframe.
    - From this point forward, all your work should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember… A-C-P)
    - Each partner should end up with their own index.html file containing basically the same html tags, in the same order, but with different content within the tags.
    - Link up the pages so a user can navigate to both pages.

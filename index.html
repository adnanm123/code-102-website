        <h2>Brief Description</h2>
        <p> Hello, everyone! My name is Adnan Mohamud, and I go by the
             pronouns he/him. I recently graduated from the University of Washington, 
             where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Informatics with a concentration 
             in Human-Computer Interaction. As part of my major requirements, I completed a few 
             coding classes, although it has been some time since I last actively used those skills. 
             I'm thrilled to be a part of this class as it presents an exciting opportunity for me to broaden my skill set. 
             Software development has always been a passion of mine, but I never had the chance to learn the 
             fundamentals from the ground up. With this program, I'm looking forward to overcoming any obstacles 
             and transforming into a professional in the field.</p>
